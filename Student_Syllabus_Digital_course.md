History GR8975

**What is a Book in the 21st Century?**

**Working with Historical Texts in a Digital Environment**

Spring 2017 

Wednesdays, 4:10pm-6pm, Studio @ Butler

Some Friday Labs, 2-4pm, Studio @ Butler

Some shared sessions with the Experimental Methods Group (Fridays 3-5pm) and Professor Dennis Tenen’s class *GU4903: Critical Computing in the Humanities*

**INSTRUCTORS**: **Terry Catapano** (CU Libraries) and **Pamela Smith** (History), with guest lectures by **Steven Feiner **(Computer Science)

This course will introduce graduate students to techniques of working in digital environments. The course is intended mainly for humanities and social science students who are novices with little or no experience in using digital platforms, but we also welcome students from all disciplines, as well as those who might be familiar with constructing websites or blogs, or even with creating minimal editions. Through hands-on assignments (with plenty of assistance), you will master a variety of skills that constitute literacy in digital humanities, and, by the end of the semester, you will be able to take your newfound digital literacy with you as you pursue your own study, research, and future work.

Throughout the course, your skills will be built by implementing them to collectively create a small scale digital edition, which will be festively launched at the end of the semester. This digital edition will draw on collaboration with and research done by the [Making and Knowing Project](http://www.makingandknowing.org/) ([http://www.makingandknowing.org/](http://www.makingandknowing.org/)) on an anonymous sixteenth-century French compilation of artistic and technical recipes (BnF Ms. Fr. 640). The Project’s existing English translation of this manuscript will constitute the "data" with which students in this course will work to create their small scale edition.  

This rare French manuscript resulted from the compilation of craft knowledge over time, followed by its subsequent "disassembly" in a late sixteenth-century workshop by an author-compiler-practitioner who experimented on techniques contained in the manuscript’s “recipes.” While the course will focus on this intriguing manuscript and the research that has been carried out on it, the skills you will learn over the course of the semester are widely applicable to other types of Digital Humanities projects, and, indeed, in many fields outside of traditional academic study.

The [Making and Knowing Project](http://www.makingandknowing.org/), directed by Professor Smith, has produced the transcription and English translation of this manuscript, "disassembling" Ms. Fr. 640 through research seminars and workshops, involving multidisciplinary teams of students and scholars. The Project is now engaged in creating a complete critical digital edition, which represents a reassembly of this manuscript in a 21st-century form. In this course, you will be an active participant in the Project’s exploration of the technologies that allow not just a *reading* of the text but an *interaction* with the content itself. This is in direct resonance with the ways that this sixteenth-century recipe collection can only be transformed from *text* to *knowledge* when the techniques contained within it are *practiced*, whether in the sixteenth century or in the Making and Knowing Laboratory reconstructions today. Through this exploration, the course aims to foster reflection on the constraints of the codex as a framework and vehicle for the production of knowledge, and to re-think the technology of the book and what it means to read a text.  To this end, the course also includes collaboration with Professor Steven Feiner’s Computer Graphics and User Interfaces Lab ([CGUI](http://graphics.cs.columbia.edu/home/home/), [http://graphics.cs.columbia.edu/home/home/](http://graphics.cs.columbia.edu/home/home/)).

*This course is one component of the **[History in Action Initiativ*e](http://historyinaction.columbia.edu/)* of the Columbia Department of History. The American Historical Association (AHA) and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation are collaborating to re-think career education for history PhD candidates at four selected universities (Columbia, Chicago, New Mexico, and UCLA) and to continue, expand, and enhance the AHA’s "**[Career Diversity and the History Ph*D](http://www.historians.org/jobs-and-professional-development/career-diversity-for-historians)*" initiative. The long-term goal is to establish a new norm: that doctoral graduates in history** and** the humanities will be equipped with the skills to pursue a wide spectrum of career opportunities and communicate their research to a broad audience.*

 

**ASSE****SSMENT****:**

Participation, initiative, effort: 10%

Weekly assignments and field notes: 30%

Final edition project:  60%

**SCHEDULE:**

**Please note: You will encounter many unfamiliar and possibly intimidating terms in the following syllabus, but FEAR NOT!  Learning a new craft involves not just "how to do" it, but also “how to talk” about it. Hands-on techniques are in general difficult to put into words, so this practitioners’ jargon is often necessary. **

**Please see ****[here** ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10uCbej4HOEBTzhUOaO5ZVJ64expe7Sm_Tojl8XaG0Go/edit)**for a short and easy to read version of the class schedule and syllabus that includes the digital skills introduced in each class.**

**Be sure to bring your computer (not tablet) to every class.**

**S****tatement on Academic Integrity**

The intellectual venture in which we are all engaged requires of faculty and students alike the highest level of personal and academic integrity. As members of an academic community, each one of us bears the responsibility to participate in scholarly discourse and research in a manner characterized by intellectual honesty and scholarly integrity.

Scholarship, by its very nature, is an iterative process, with ideas and insights building one upon the other. Collaborative scholarship requires the study of other scholars' work, the free discussion of such work, and the explicit acknowledgement of those ideas in any work that inform our own. This exchange of ideas relies upon a mutual trust that sources, opinions, facts, and insights will be properly noted and carefully credited.

In practical terms, this means that, as students, you must be responsible for the full citations of others' ideas in all of your research papers and projects; you must be scrupulously honest when taking your examinations; you must always submit your own work and not that of another student, scholar, or internet agent.

Any breach of this intellectual responsibility is a breach of faith with the rest of our academic community. It undermines our shared intellectual culture, and it cannot be tolerated. Students failing to meet these responsibilities should anticipate being asked to leave Columbia.

**Disability-Related Accommodations**

In order to receive disability-related academic accommodations, students must first be registered with Disability Services (DS). More information on the DS registration process is available online at [www.health.columbia.edu/ods](http://www.health.columbia.edu/ods). Faculty must be notified of registered students’ accommodations before exam or other accommodations will be provided. Students who have (or think they may have) a disability are invited to contact Disability Services for a confidential discussion at (212) 854-2388 (Voice/TTY) or by email at [disability@columbia.edu](mailto:disability@columbia.edu).

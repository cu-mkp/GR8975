Orgues

Then they are affustés on a rather thick board close to each other and notches are made onto the board this way fig_p022v_2https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9-oNrvWdlO5RnQ2Ri1PenA1aDA. 

And through these notches is fit the harquebus’s hook which has a hole through which we pass, from under, iron pegs. When you want to aim, you affuste the middle and side ones. If you want to make double, triple or four ranks or more, you have to put similar board rank one on the other, like the first one. This manner of making an orgue fait faute @ and makes it very stable. Because the other ones made of one massive and solid piece have cannons of only one and a half pan long. They therefore are used only for a salvo at an entrance or to protect a gate.



A small hooked harquebus a-crocke weighs 40 pounds and is 4 pans long, and is to be loaded to the touch hole, its breech is three cannonballs thick, its front two.

 



The double cannon is nothing different from the big ordinary cannon, apart from the fact that its cannonball has one line of thickness - or of diametre - more. A line is a twelfth part of a cannonball. At the breech, it has a thickess of one line more than the cannon, and the mouth is half a line thicker. Its load is six or seven lbs of powder, more than a cannon, that is to say of two big linstocks. Its cannonball weighs 56 lb. Thirty horses are necessary to carry it. It weakens the walls more than a cannon. But it is very uneasy to drive. This is why it is unused today and is more appropriate to be brought to a nearby place for close combat or for a [ceremonial] entry, rather than for an ordinary execution. They are called basilics, and they are unmovable pieces.

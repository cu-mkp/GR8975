Oil of sulfur for the teeth

Some people whiten them with compositions of eau forte, however one says that this corrupts them afterwards and causes them to blacken. One says that oil of sulfur is excellent, but it needs to be applied in this way: take as much clove oil as can be held in a nutshell, as much rose honey, and seven or eight drops of oil of sulfur, and put it all together, and after having cleaned the teeth with a small burin, touch them lightly with a good bit of cotton dipped in the aforementioned oils and leave it for a little while, then spit it out or rinse the mouth with tepid water, and repeat two or three times. Oil of sulfur penetrates and is corrosive, and l but the clove oil and the rose honey correct it. Therefore use it with discretion.

p092v_a1Sand of river tellins and mussels

 The long shells that can be found in rivers of fresh water, being calcinated, make a white and very fine [impalpable] sand which moulds very clean..

p092v_a2Freezing  mercury

It can be frozen, as I tested, letting it boil one or two hours in a rather large iron pan putting, for each ℥ of ☿, ii  ℥ of  vert-de-gris and  vitriol of saltpetre, each in the same quantity, with enough of the blacksmith's old water.

Or melt 4 ℥ of tin, and when it  has cooled, purify it by removing the filth on the top, then make a hole and inside there add  i ℥ of ☿ and if you remelt it, it will be like tin but it will be fragile. If you want to know if it is tin or ☿, redden a shovel and put a small piece of your ingot on the top. If it is tin, the piece will melt but remain, but if it is ☿, it will melt immediately then, crackling quite hard, it will evaporate. It must be frozen in a ladle or in a hollow crucible, and make the hole medium sized.

It can also be frozen, as I tried, that is to say with aqua fortis which before corroded a bit of silver. This, mixed, will make tin and lead fluid.

p092v_a3Mixture

Pure tin, frozen mercury, smells like tin. Iced tin, pure lead, as much of one as of the other, makes a substance that  melts very quickly but that is fragile and white. I think that it would be good for soldering. [Takes a] long time to cool.

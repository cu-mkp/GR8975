<figure>+</figure>

<ab>One must first make the branches from <m>wood</m> or take a fantastical <m>thorn branch</m>, then melt a pound of the best possible <m>clear</m> <m>pine resin</m> and add one ounce of finely ground <m>vermilion</m> together with <m>walnut oil,</m> and if you add a little <m>Venice</m> <m>lake</m> the color will be all the more vivid, and stir all together into the <m>resin,</m> molten over a <m>charcoal</m> fire, not over an open flame, lest it catch fire. Then dip in your branches with a swirling motion. And should there remain any filaments, turn the branch over the heat of the <m>charcoal</m>.</ab>

<m>Colophony</m> is nothing other than <m>resin</m> that has been cooked again. To do it well, you take a <m>leaded</m> <tl>pot</tl> and melt the <m>resin</m>, boiling it over the brazier for a good hour until it appears not thick but clear and liquid like <m>water</m> and it easily runs as a thread off the end of a stick, which you use to crush and test it. Then pour it through a coarse <m>canvas</m> or <m>tammy cloth</m> so that it falls into the strongest <m>vinegar</m> you can find, because the <m>vinegar</m> makes it strong and makes it less brittle. Repeat this two or three times and it will be fine and well purified. To imitate your <m>coral</m>, you can mix a fourth part of <m>mastic</m> with your purified <m>resin</m> to make it more solid and finer, and if you should use just one drop of <m>mastic</m>, it would be all the better, but it would take too long.

<ab><margin>right-top</margin>It is made like <m>cement</m>, which is stronger when mixed with crushed <m>glass</m> rather than with <m>brick</m>. In the same way, together with the <m>vermilion</m>, one mixes in <m>opaque red enamel</m>, finely ground. It is the same way with all <m>enamel</m> colors.</ab>

</div><div><id>p003r_a2</id><head><m>Varnish</m> for paintings</head>

<ab>Take a pound of <m>Venice turpentine</m> and heat it in a <tl>pot</tl> until it simmers, put in half a pound of the <m>whitest turpentine oil</m> you can find and stir all together well on a <m>charcoal</m> fire and take it off immediately after, and it is done. But if you find it too thick, add more <m>oil</m>, whereas if it is too clear, you can thicken it by putting a little <m>turpentine</m>. And so you will give it whatever consistency you want. It could be made without <m>fire</m>, but it is more desiccative when heated. It is appropriate for panel paintings and other painted things, without distorting the colors or yellowing, and dries both in the shade and under the sun, overnight, and during the summer as well as in the winter. It is usually sold 15 sols a pound.</ab>

<ab><margin>left-bottom</margin>You need a little more <m>turpentine</m> than <m>turpentine oil</m> to thicken the varnish, which you need to apply with your finger in order to spread it thinner and less thick because when it is thick, it turns yellow and gathers [together]. <m>Varnish</m> is not used to make paintings shine, because it just takes the light out of them.</ab>

<ab><margin>bottom</margin>But it is used to enhance colors which have soaked in and to keep them from dust. <m>Mastic varnish</m> does not resist rain, whereas <m>oil</m> and <m>rosin varnishes</m> do.</ab>

 

</div><div><id>p003r_a3</id><head>Thick <m>varnish</m> for floorboards</head>

 

<ab>There is a type of <m>varnish</m> that takes a long time to dry and is still damp up to two months after it has been applied to the floorboards. But the following <m>varnish</m> does not remain damp like previous ones, which were made of <m>linseed oil</m> from <pl>Aux</pl> boiled with <m>garlic</m> to extinguish them and rid them of fat, and also with <m>wheat</m>. And this old one yellowed over time and made the blue color of paintings greenish. This one is made like former <sup><m>varnishes</m></sup> except that one puts in <m>common thick turpentine</m></ab>

p043r_a1Mericoton and pavis

One should graft them before Christmas so that they will not freeze too much.

One must apply four layers of painters' distemper glue onto the plaster portrait, leaving one layer to dry at a time. Then apply gently some burnt English point ground on a marble slab, or some lead burnt, ground and distempered with a bit of gum or glue. When dry, rub gently with a little cotton and the plaster portrait will look like lead. Others grind minium with quicksilver.

p043r_a3Purpurine

Take half an ounce of soft tin, melt it in a spoon. Once it is melted, throw in an ℥ of ☿, mix together. Once they are cold, grind on a porphyry slab. Then take an ℥ of sal ammoniac and an ℥ of the yellowest sulfur that may be found, grind both. And then mix very well all the aforementioned materials. Then put all together into a glass sublimatorium. Hold this over a small fire for an hour, and for an hour over a stronger fire, and for an hour over a very strong fire, and it will be ready. Then, to use it, apply resin black with the glue used by painters to paint, two or three times, until it is quite black. Then apply a bit of varnish. Once it is dry, apply the purpurine dry with a finger where you want. The more you apply, the finer it will look. Then, if you like, you can apply varnish on top.

Apply some black with glue on the medal, as described above, and then varnish it. Once dry, rub it with English point using a brush or your finger. The said rubbed point embellishes lead medals.

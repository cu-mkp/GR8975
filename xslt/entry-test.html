      <h1> Lute for luting your molds </h1>
      
      
      <p>I have not found a lute that is made more quickly than this one, nor a
         better one. Take some of the lean earth that artillery founders and bell founders
         use to make their trusseaulx and molds, which is lean and sandy. Soak it
         moderately like a very thick mortar. Mix into it about one half of horse
         manure and then beat it well. Afterwards mix in one third of cloth
         waste or cloth shavings and beat it again quite strongly. You can reheat your
         mold as soon as the lute is ready.

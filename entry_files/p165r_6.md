Repairing snakes and lizards

You could make some marks according to the form of their scales, making some bigger ones and some smaller ones, according to the shape of the neck, the body and the tail. If there is something broken, you can attach it with small iron or steel nails, and glue it with some mouth glue, then cover the whole thing with gray or black wax.  But it is necessary to let the glue dry for one day without touching it.

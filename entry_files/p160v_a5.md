Catching birds

During winter, when birds have molted, skin them and fill them with cloth and stuffing, or dry them well in an oven. Then arrange your birds on trees, have some [look like they are] singing, [look like they have assembled] and are numerous.

the oven must not be too hot. This [method] is good in the summer, because flies would set into the eyes and make works before they [birds] could dry. You can work on the birds more easily in the winter, because they dry by themselves.

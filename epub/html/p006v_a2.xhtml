         Etch with aqua fortis on iron or copper whatever you have pounced and drawn there, next make it neat with a burin or chisel. Then pour soft tin, yet unused, onto polished marble and flatten it, making it quite thin, with a wooden board. Or else pour it on a table as is done with lead, or put it through a roll-press. Next lay your tin plate over the engraving, and over the tin plate put a piece of felt and strike it with a hammer. Then gild it in the following manner.

      <h3>Birds</h3>
      
      
      <p>Those that are caught at Michaelmas are good to keep, but those that are caught in March die,
         because they are starting to fall in love. Ortolans are fed oats all summer so that they eat without getting fat,
         to be more suitable for hunting and helping to catch others. Then, when one wants
         to fatten them to sell, one gives them millet.
         They sing at night. They must be caught after mid-July and before Michaelmas, because
         after the period when they have their young
         in this country, they leave as turtledoves do. Siskins should also be caught after
         All Saints' Day and before
         Christmas, because afterwards they leave for the mountains to brood.

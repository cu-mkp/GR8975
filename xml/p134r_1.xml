    <heading>To repair a pierced mold</heading>
    <block> If the molded animal pulls of in certain places, moves from the place you had fixed it,
        or has not completely died, or if you didn't fix it well with the iron pins or with the
        melted wax, or if the animal hasn't the right thickness on the outside at the relief, or if
        it is pierced, instead of removing the animal from the mold, peel away the weak parts, or
        the pierced part, and make holes all around these parts, then dip the back side of the mold,
        quickly cast onto this place with the same soaked sand which will go into the holes, the
        cast will adhere to the first cast. But you will have to lute this spot afterwards.</block>

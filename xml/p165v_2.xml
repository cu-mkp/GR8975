<heading>Keeping animals</heading>

<block><purpose type="advice"><activity type="molding animals">Having molded them once, if you want to keep them for molding again, put them back into the mixture of <material>urine</material>, <material>vinegar</material> and <material>spirits</material> where you killed the others, and they will keep for a long time without decaying. If you have a cut on your hand, take care that this mixture does not touch it.</activity></purpose></block>

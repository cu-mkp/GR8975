        Dust guards wheat against being worm-eaten. And to clean it well when it is stained &amp; like rust, pass some ashes through a sieve and mix them with the wheat, then sift the whole thing with a bolting cloth made from rough cloth or canvas. The ashes will pass through &amp; your wheat will stay nicely yellow &amp; very fine.

 <heading>Thick <material>varnish</material> for floorboards</heading>
    

<activity type="varnish for floorboards"/>
<purpose type="making"/>

    <block>There is a type of <material>varnish</material> that takes a long time to dry and is still damp up to two <time>months</time> after it has been applied to the floorboards. But the following <material>varnish</material> does not remain damp like previous ones, which were made of <material>linseed oil from Aux</material> boiled with <material>garlic</material> to extinguish them and rid them of <material>fat</material>, and also with <material>wheat</material>. And this old one yellowed over time and made the blue color of paintings greenish. This one is made like former <material>varnishes</material> except that one puts in <material>common thick turpentine</material>.</block>

    <block> I used the one from which I had extracted the <material>oil</material>. I crushed it very finely even more
        into a <material>steel</material> mortar with a <tool>pestle</tool> [which was] rough like a file. I crushed it very finely
        into a cottony, downy powder. I mixed it with the sand and soaked both matters together, and
        I casted it en <material>noyau</material>. It molded very clean and there is no doubt that it will withstand
        fire. </block>

    <heading>Mold made from two casts</heading>
    <block> It opens once anealed. To clean it after, fix the <tool>clamps</tool> again, lute the mold,
        particularly the joints. Then let the earth slowly dry. When it doesn't smoke anymore, let
        the mold cool down until you can hold it without burning your skin. Then put your molds into
        the <tool>presses</tool>, or into a <tool>pot</tool> filled with <material>sand</material>,
        and cast with <material>tin</material>. If you cast <material>gold</material> or
            <material>silver</material> your mold needs to be cast twice, and cast when your mold
        becomes red-hot.</block>

    <block position="left-top">If your heated mold […], shrinks because of the bad quality of the
        plaster, open it after the first heating, tighten it, then lute it and clamp it
        again.</block>

  <heading> Lute for luting your molds </heading>
  <block purpose="making">I have not found a <material>lute</material> that is made more quickly than this one, nor a
    better one. Take some of the <material>lean earth that artillery founders and bell founders use</material>
      to make their trusseaulx and molds, which is lean and sandy. Soak it moderately
      like a very thick <material>mortar</material>. Mix into it about one half of <material>horse manure</material> and
    then beat it well. Afterwards mix in one third of <material>cloth waste</material> or <material>cloth
      shavings</material> and beat it again quite strongly. You can reheat your mold as soon as the
    <material>lute</material> is ready. </block>

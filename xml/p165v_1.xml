Wash them first in clear water, after they have died in the mixture of <material>vinegar</material> and <material>urine</material>. And with a <tool>sponge </tool>clean off their mouth, eyes and head of the froth coming out, because the <material>sand</material> would never set well there and would become lumpy.</activity></block>

<block position="left-top">If you want to keep their mouths open, insert a little bit of <material>harpsichord string</material>, which will not take up much space.</block>

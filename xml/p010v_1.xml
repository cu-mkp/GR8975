                    >batture</foreign></material>, which is made of <material><foreign
                    language="french">colle forte</foreign></material> soaked for <time>24
                hours</time> in <material>water</material> then gently boiled so it is not too

            to a boil.</purpose>
        <purpose type="observation">And on top of this layer, which will soon be dry, you will be
            able to paint in <material>oil</material>, which will soften the layer even more, and
            which will also serve to make an underlayer for <material>gold</material>.
                <material>Alum water</material> also keeps <material>oil</material> from
            running.</purpose>

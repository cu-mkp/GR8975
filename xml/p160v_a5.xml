<heading>Catching birds</heading>

<block><activity type="catching birds">During winter, when <material>birds</material> have molted, <purpose type="making">skin them and fill them with cloth and stuffing, or dry them well in an oven. Then arrange your <material>birds</material> on <material>trees</material>, have some [look like they are] singing, [look like they have assembled] and are numerous.</purpose></activity></block>

<block>the <tool>oven</tool> must not be too hot. <purpose type="advice">This [method] is good in the summer, because flies would set into the eyes and make works before they [birds] could dry. You can work on the birds more easily in the winter, because they dry by themselves.</purpose></block>

    <heading>Thing that cannot be released from the mold</heading>
    <block> You must cut it inside the mold in order to burn it. Cut it with <tool>scissors</tool> at once, that
        way blood doesn't flow on the mold, and doesn't make dirty. Because this dirt would be
        removed with difficulty when reheated. Then place your mold into a furnace, or something
        similar, in order to quickly dry the mold which must be removed before the forming of crusts
        or molds.@ </block>
    <block position="left-middle"> + When you mold small <animal>lizards</animal>, and when you want to peel away the
        first molded part, start to peel away the heads, you will know its place thanks to the
        <tool>needle</tool>. Don't peel away the legs before peeling away the entire body, to avoid that the
        naked body, moving,doesn't remove the legs from their place, which would not be easy to put
        back into place. When you remove the small <tool>needles</tool> fixing the legs, block the legs or press
        the legs with something, that way while removing the <tool>needles</tool> the legs won't move; finally,
        you can fix the legs again with <material>wax</material>.</block>

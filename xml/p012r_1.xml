        <material>Sulfur</material> is made beautiful by mixing in <material>soot
                <color>black</color></material> or <material_format>powdered
                <material>sanguine</material></material_format>, which makes it harder and stronger.
        After letting it melt entirely until it becomes liquid and similar to
            <material>oil</material>, then mixing it with <material>verdigris</material>, you can
        use it for casting a <animal>lizard</animal> or something else in
            <material>plaster</material>, very cleanly.</block>

        <purpose type="advice"/>You must not cast it until it has cooled down and lost all its
        bubbles and eyes, and its surface has fallen and become flat as <material>water</material>.
            <material>Soot black</material> gives it a fine luster and makes it neater. Use
                <material_format><color>yellow</color>
            <material>sulfur</material> of the best kind</material_format>, as the
                <material_format><color>grey</color>ish natural
            <material>sulfur</material></material_format> is no good. Don't cast it in the wind and
        cold for it would fill with bubbles. </block>

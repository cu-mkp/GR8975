    <heading>Porosity and little holes which are in the mold </heading>

    <block> It oftens happens when you cast two or three molds one after the other using the same
        dish, because the last casting comes from the bottom of the dish and is thicker, and then
        often the last cast which comes from the bottom and which is the thickest of the dish, may
        easily become porous. Cast thinner and neater, as long as you blow very strongly on the
        soaked sand while casting in order to clear the little air bubbles. </block>

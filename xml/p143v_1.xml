    <block> You can mold them "en <material>noyau</material>" like <animal>crayfish</animal>, first
        with one side being made higher with <material>clay</material>, which is hollow, and then
        you open it from the other side and make the second casting. You can just as well cast them
        "en chassis", provided that they release well. If they do not, you can do a rough cast in
            <material>wax</material>, or you can fill up the cavities which do not release well with
            <material>wax</material> or <material>clay</material>. </block>

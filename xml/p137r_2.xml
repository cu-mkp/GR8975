        <profession>Foundry workers</profession> who make large casts to mold statues, clean the
        dirt from these molds with <material>calamine</material>, and a lot of <material>sal
            ammoniac</material> in order to make moulds clear and neat. When they want to cast they
        add a lot of tin. Dampness and cold could spoil their works, that is the reason why even a
        small source of water in the hole can damage the whole thing. </block>

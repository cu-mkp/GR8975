    <heading>How to adjust a bent gun barrel</heading>

    <block>Take off the <tool>breech</tool> and put it [the barrel] on a well-leveled
            <tool>table</tool> set perpendicular to the floor, and insert a very smooth
            <tool>string</tool> without knots, on each end of which there is a plumb hanging from
        each side. Then look in the barrel along the string, and if it does not touch equally all
        over, note the place where it does not touch and hit it with a <tool>hammer</tool> on
        the exterior of this this side in the same place, and this will make it straight. Do this
        all around it.</block>

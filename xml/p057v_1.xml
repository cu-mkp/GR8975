    <heading>Tanner</heading>

    <block>Tanners use small <material>skins</material> of <animal>lambs</animal> and young
            <animal>goats</animal> nearly as delicate as <material>parchments</material> and they
        keep them in some humid places and keep wetting them. When they want to print some stories
        on it they lay them in their molding hollows of their figure and then on top they spread
        some greasy fine <material>earth</material> used for trimming <material>wool</material>
        fabrics, well pressed and beaten and slightly humid and soft and then put on the
            <material>earth</material> a small one-piece board and put the whole under a press and
        leave that dry there. After the earth the <material>leather</material> only remains very
        neatly printed [missing word] of the size of a pea. And then apply on the leather two or
        three <material>black copperas</material> and <m>iron scale</m> layers one after the other
        like the <pro>tanners</pro> do. And since this tincture is astringent and shrinks the
        leather will be stronger more more easily printable. Once dried stick on the reverse some
            <material>fabric</material> with strong <material>glue</material>, and by doing so one
        can quickly imitate big statues and very fine medals and paint them and [illegible] and are
        light and can be carried and last for a long time. What can be printed on a relief can be
        made differently and can be reheated with <tool>a hot iron tool</tool>.</block>

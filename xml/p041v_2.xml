    <heading>Sheared ewes</heading>
    <block>If the shearer wounds them at some point, he applies the very excrement of the ewe on it.
        When they are fat, they are easier to shear and do not get hurt as easily.</block>
    <block position="left-middle">If the shearer wants to 'viscorter' them, that is to castrate them
        as [they] are one or two years old, he must not have been with his wife, because this would
        cause the sheep to die.</block>

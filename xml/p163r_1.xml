<block>T<purpose type="description">hey readily make their perfumes with <material>half amber</material> and <material>half musk</material>, and a <material>little civet</material>, because the scent of <material>amber</material> is stronger than the scent of <material>musk</material>.</purpose></block>

<block><purpose type="observation">To save using amber, <profession>perfume-makers</profession> readily add add a <unit>small quantity</unit> of <material>musk</material> to the white layers, in order to get a stronger scent. But to remove or hide the blackness of musk, they add a bit of <material>starch from England</material>, which is perfectly white.</purpose></block>

<block>To give off a scent of white amber, in the same way that the <name type="corporate">Portuguese</name> do, take a <material>chunk of amber</material> that you have broken up into pieces. Having put in a small <tool>silver porringer</tool> a <unit>spoon</unit> of <material>flower oil</material>, should you not have some, <material>linseed oil</material>. That is to say, use the type of <tool>silver spoon</tool> one might use at the table. Pour into this your <material>ambergris</material>, then place it on a low fire, it will melt quickly if your <material>amber</material> is of good quality, and there will be no lumps. Having melted it all, put in a small bit of civet, and melt it all and blend it well together. Then take your gloves which you have cleaned and dried properly, and lightly dip the <tool>edge of your finger</tool> around the edge of the oil, with patience slowly spread the oil along the glove, and rub the glove between your <tool>hands</tool> and trace along the fingers and its stitches, one after the other. Leave it to dry. Then repeat the previous procedure until you have used up all of the <material>amber</material>.</block>

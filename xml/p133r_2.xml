    <heading>Casting the feet of small lizards in <material>gold</material> and <material>silver</material></heading>

    <block>Because the feet of these [<animal>lizards</animal>] that are very small are [also] very fine, once you
        have molded the top and you have uncover the vents and underneath the feet are covered
        lightly with <material>wax</material>, and then cast a second mold. And the wax that one removes, it leaves a
        little cast for these said feet, and again such that the underneath [part] comes out in one
        piece that you can repair well, And the scales on top of the toes come [out] well.</block>
    <block position="left-top"> Around the big lizard nails, put on each a small round of <material>wax</material> to
        make the cast like this. </block>

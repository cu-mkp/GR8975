    <heading>Pounce for scratching satin</heading>

    <block>After pouncing with crushed flour or chalk, in order that the dots of the pounce not be
        erased, go over the trace with egg white beaten with the milk or bark of a fig tree, which
        will immediately make the egg white clear up like water, without becoming opaque, it will
        maintain the trace that you will go over again and scratch with a piece of glass or
        penknife.</block>

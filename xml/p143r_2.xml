    <heading> Moulders from Foix</heading>

    <block> Those who mould from across the way make their sand from crocum ferri and calcinated
        slate, but slate always retains its bumpiness and swells because it is a fatty. In the
        noyau, it is not good; in sand, it can be put to use. They the moulders from Foix sieve
        their sand, grind it on porphyry, and soak it in water, and they keep the finest bits which
        are on the top, then they reheat it. </block>

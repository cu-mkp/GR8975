    <heading><material>Oil of sulfur</material> for the teeth</heading>
    
    <block>Some people whiten them with compositions of <material>eau forte</material>, however one says
        that this corrupts them afterwards and causes them to blacken. One says that <material>oil of
            sulfur</material> is excellent, but it needs to be applied in this way: take as much <material>clove
            oil</material> as can be held in a <material>nutshell</material>, as much <material>rose honey</material>, and seven or
        eight drops of <material>oil of sulfur</material>, and put it all together, and after having cleaned the
        teeth with a small burin, touch them lightly with a bit of <material>cotton</material>
        dipped in the aforementioned oils and leave it for a little while, then spit it out or rinse
        the mouth with tepid water, and repeat two or three times. <material>Oil of sulfur</material> penetrates
        and is corrosive, but the <material>clove oil</material> and the <material>rose honey</material>
        correct it. Therefore use it with discretion.</block>

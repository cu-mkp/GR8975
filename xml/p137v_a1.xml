    <heading>Wetting <material>sand</material> to mold flat medals</heading>
    <block> Flat medals, made of <material>wax</material> or metal, must be oiled very lightly and then touched with a
        brush of <material>spirits</material>. So that the already moistened mold takes well the oiled thing without
        rejecting it, one warms the water well in order to wet the <material>sand</material>, because with cold water it
        would be rejected. It is necessary to <material>oil</material> medals, because they do not expand and in this way
        would break the mold. Animals, which expand, do not need oiling. The hot water much be of
        such a heat that you cannot keep your figure in it without it becoming too warm. Wet the
        thickest sand for flat and solid medals rather than [for] <animal>lizards</animal> and finer things. Once
        your <material>sand</material> has set, clean and scrape your mold on one side and the other, and on the bottom
        edge of the thrown side of the medal, make a notch so that it is easier to take out. Lower
        the mold, scraping what surrounds the medal, so that on all sides you can take it out easily
        without it damaging the mold. Then make some gashes around the first mold used to throw so
        that the second time that you throw in it, it will be identical to the first one, and in the
        same way, make a notch at the bottom of the mold, where the held of the item cast lies. Also
        make some [gashes] in the sides of the cast. This done, wet the back of the first mold in
        oiled water, and after the second casting moisten it with warm water if you have molded your
        medal in a <material>noyau</material> mold. Having done the first cast, and this one having set, cut around the
        edge of the medal with the point of a knife so that it comes out of the throw and is not
        buried in it. Then having made the second cast, and having opened your mold, take away the
        medal in one go, with two <tool>knife</tool> points, one on the side of the cast object and one on the
        side of the head, which is at the opposite end. </block>
    <block position="left-middle">Take care not to <material>oil</material> your medal too much because if the seeps out,
        it prevents the sand from serving its purpose and coming together and renders it wavy and
        lumpy. You must only touch the middle of the medal with the tip of your oil brush and then
        smear the oil everywhere. </block>

    <block position="left-bottom"> Make especially sure that the throw is as wide as you can on the
        medal and holds it together well. The gate of your cast must always be big and always
        narrowing as you go towards the medal. Also do not forget to notch the gate of your cast. </block>

    <block> If you want to cast <material>gold</material>, <material>silver</material>, <material>copper</material> or brass, it is necessary that they be
        perfectly red, and fired on the inside when you cast, and perfectly reheated twice, if there
        is something inside to be burnt and cleaned. </block>
    <block> The molds of animals that you burn must be reheated in such a manner that the animal
        burns up. But if it has big bones, it is frustrating to take out and ☿ often breaks delicate
        things because of its heaviness. One does not put ☿in molds that can open. It is often molds
        for flowers that do not open because they are cast in one go. </block>
    <block> When you want to reheat your molds, fix <tool>cramp-irons</tool> on the joints, so that when they
        reheat they will not bend, contract or break. This is done once the cast is made. </block>
    <block> The scrapings of the mold can also be used instead of bricks after being reheated, and
        also the leftover bits of the mold that have already been used. You can also pat it over
        important things, like works in gold or silver. You can also reheat it and blend it with
        water diluted with <material>sal ammoniac</material>, like <material>spar</material> from <place>Germany</place>, and is excellent <material>sand</material> for box molds
        for all metals. </block>
    <block> The molds with things that need to be burnt out inside them, those ones will not open
        until the thing that is inside is burnt, like the molds for <animal>crayfish</animal>, <animal>crab</animal>, <animal>great-horned
            beetles</animal>. Do not open the molds in which you will burn something, not before the thing is
        burnt, it could be crayfishes, crabs, stag beetles, pictures, and pieces of <material>wax</material> and <material>black
            sulphur</material>, which do not come out of the mold [easily]. </block>
    <block> You must not mold on <material>brick</material> or <material>wood</material> because they absorb and attract water too early, and
        do not allow the sand to set. The best place for [the sand] is on a fresh layers of <material>clay</material>.
        And yet, I have experienced that <material>grey earth</material> dries out the mold too quickly. <material>Yellow [earth]</material>
        is better. </block>
    <block position="left-middle">For medals, and flat things, the sand must be quite thick and
        moistened so that it sets quickly. And when the sand is thusly thick, you can shake and move
        the table where you mold lies, so that [the movement] makes the <material>sand</material> go everywhere. But when
        the sand is clear, as for flowers and herbs, you cannot shake it, nor can you do it when
        there is something attached to wax or other things which are prone to come off, such as the
        legs of <animal>crayfish</animal> or other similar things. And if by chance your sand is too thick, you must
        quickly add some water. And having put the sand in the water, examine it until it is thick
        on the bottom and clear on top. The clearest is thrown in immediately and then bubbles and
        the thickest is thrown in at the end so that it strengthens the mold. </block>

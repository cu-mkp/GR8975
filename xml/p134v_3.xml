    <heading> Secret for soldering small works made of <material>gold</material> and <material>silver</material> </heading>
    <block> If some little pieces of legs cannot be easily removed from <material>gold</material> or <material>silver</material> casting, it
        is because you didn't cast wax under these parts. Beat some soldering <material>gold</material> very finely, then
        cut it into very fine flakes, cut the quantity you need. Take some of this phlegm or white
        and thick saliva which is on the teeth, put some of this matter to the place you want to
        solder with the point of a <tool>burin</tool>, then place your flakes, then put to the opposite part a
        mixture made of a small quantity of soaked fat earth and saliva, thanks to the mixture the
        solder will better adhere. Then pulverize a bit of <material>borax</material> on it, and heat up <material>Quince pulp seed
        water</material> to a boil and others too.</block>

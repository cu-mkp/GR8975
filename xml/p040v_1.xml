    <heading>Cross of the commanders of Malta</heading>

    <block>The fine rouge clair which is the background of the white enamel cross is of fine
        dragon's blood drops soaked with eau de vie or Indian laque plate, which I believe is made
        in Flanders, distempered with clear turpentine and mastic drops and applied on a silver
        leaf, not the one used by painters but a thicker one, which is burnished by the makers of
        foil backings for gemstones or by goldsmiths, and that gives it its fine brilliance.</block>

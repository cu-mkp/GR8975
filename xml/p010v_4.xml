        <purpose type="making"/>Hard-boil some <material>eggs</material>, cut them in half and take
        the <material>yolks</material> out, and between the two halves of the
            <material>white</material> put a bit of <material>ceruse</material>, and tie the two
        halves together with <tool><material>thread</material></tool>. Then boil in
            <material_format>clear <material>water</material></material_format>, and it will become
        black, and thus the <material>ceruse</material> will be purified. Some reheat it over
            <tool>fire</tool> and it becomes very white. </block>
